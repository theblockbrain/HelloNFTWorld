# HelloNFTWorld - BACKEND
Repo for the Hello NFT World Hackathon by OpenSea and Repl_it

## Intro
Hello and welcome to the backend of our hackathon project - the better NFT Pricing estimator.

Here you will find the parts where the magic happens.
There are 3 main parts to this App:

- Fetching Metadata & OpenSea Sales Data
- Calculating Rarity
- Exponential Regression Models
- Forecasting Prices

The Mongo-DB Cluster here can simply be swapped out for any document database, as no data in required on the server to start with - everything is dynamically generated.

I will try to add an .env-example File in the upcoming days, to make it easier for you to spin up your own version of this feisty little backend.
# FAQ

## What about the frontend?
Can be found here: https://github.com/theblockbrain/hellonftworld-frontend

## What about comments?
Ain't nobody got time for that, 7 days is very little for one person to develop FE and BE simultaniously.
