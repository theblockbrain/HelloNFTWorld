# HelloNFTWorld - BACKEND
Repo for the Hello NFT World Hackathon by OpenSea and Repl_it -

## Intro
Hello and welcome to the backend of our hackathon project - the better NFT Pricing estimator.

Here you will find the parts where the magic happens.
There are 3 main parts to this App:

- Fetching Metadata & OpenSea Sales Data
- Calculating Rarity
- Exponential Regression Models
- Forecasting Prices

The Mongo-DB Cluster here can simply be swapped out for any document database, as no data in required on the server to start with - everything is dynamically generated.

I will try to add an .env-example File in the upcoming days, to make it easier for you to spin up your own version of this feisty little backend.
And please excuse the absense of comments, it was a hackathon and I only had a week for both back- and front-end.
